Hi everyone,

This is a blog post for my Cloud computing class, in which I would like to explore a real-world topic. In my experience there a lot of hungarians who don't speak English so when they try to get yourself informed about international news, they have to  rely on the hungarian journalists' translation skills and objectivity. Furthermore, there are news that are not considered important enough for writing an article about, but there is a video that is available online. With the help of Amazon services I would like to show, how this problem could be solved.
